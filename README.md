### DataBase Design

### Normalizing definition
Normalizing a database table means organizing the information in a way that makes it easier to manage and prevents mistakes. It's like putting your toys away in a toy box so you can find them easily and don't lose any. In a database, we put similar information together in a table and make sure each piece of information is only stored in one place. This helps to avoid repeating information and makes it easier to update the information if needed. Normalizing a database table is like keeping your room clean and tidy so you can find everything you need quickly and easily.

### Pre-Normalizing 
This is the database table named "Students" before normalizing; it stores information about martial arts students. It has 20 fields, including a primary key field "CustomerID" and also relevant data values, such as Varchar and Boolean. Please note this is a mock-up and tables and data values may change during design and implementation.
